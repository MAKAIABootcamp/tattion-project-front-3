Tattion is a dynamic web page designed to streamline the process of finding a good tattoo artist for users and provide tattoo artists with the opportunity to reach new clients. With Tattion, users can upload their own tattoo designs or choose from a wide gallery of available designs.

## Features

- Tattoo design uploads: Users can upload their own tattoo designs to share them with the community.
- Extensive design gallery: Tattion offers a wide variety of tattoo designs for users to explore and choose from.
- Tattoo artist profiles: Tattoo artists can create profiles and showcase their works and designs.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the Tattion project in your local development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tu_usuario/tattion.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd tattion
```
3. Install the dependencies using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm install
```
4. Run the project in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
